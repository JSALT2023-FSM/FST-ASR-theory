abstract="A semigroup (M, *) consists of a nonempty set M on which an associative operation * is defined. If M is a semigroup in which there exists an element e satisfying m * e = m = e * m for all m ∈ M, then M is called a monoid having identity element e. This element can easily seen to be unique, and is usually denoted by 1m- Note that a semigroup (M, *) which is not a monoid can be canonically embedded in a monoid M{\textasciiacutex} - M ∪ {\{}e{\}} where e is some element not in M, and where the operation * is extended to an operation on M{\textasciiacutex} by defining e * M{\textasciiacutex} = M{\textasciiacutex} = M{\textasciiacutex} * e for all m{\textasciiacutex} ∈ m{\textasciiacutex}. An element m of M idempotent if and only if m * m = m. A semigroup (M, *) is commutative if and only if m * M{\textasciiacutex} = M{\textasciiacutex} * m for all m.m{\textasciiacutex} ∈ M.",

abstract="The modules over a ring are an important tool in characterizing properties of the ring and so it is only natural that we should look at the corresponding construction over semirings. And, indeed, many of the constructions from ring theory can be transfered, at least partially, to this more general setting. Moreover, many important constructions in pure and applied mathematics can, as we shall see, be understood as semimodules over appropriate semirings. In this chapter we lay the foundations for the study of semimodules.",

abstract="This chapter describes a general representation and algorithmic framework for speech speechrecognitionrecognition based on weighted finite-state weighted transducertransducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for major components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical grammars, and word or phone lattices. General algorithms for building and optimizing transducer models are presented, including composition for combining models, weighted determinization and minimization for optimizing time and space requirements, and a weight pushing algorithm for redistributing transition weights optimally for speech recognition. The application of these methods to large-vocabulary recognition tasks is explained in detail, and experimental results are given, in particular for the North American Business News (NAB) task, in which these methods were used to combine HMMs, full cross-word triphones, a lexicon of 40000 words, and a large trigram grammar into a single weighted transducer that is only somewhat larger than the trigram word grammar and that runs NAB in real time on a very simple decoder. Another example demonstrates that the same methods can be used to optimize lattices for second-pass recognition.",
